# Javascript Code Quiz

## Description

My motivation on building this webpage was to use the skills we learned this week in class, and create a Javascript Code Quiz using Javascript. The reason building this webpage was to allow users visit, and play a five question multiple choice quiz on questions pertaining to Javascript. I've set all my needed variables at the top of the script, created a questions variable and wrapped 5 objects in that array, created a for loop to go through each question, and created a leaderboard for players to post their high score with their initials using the localStorage.

## Usage

This webpage was created to quiz bootcamp students on some questions pertaining to Javascript. Players simply visit the page, and can click the "Start Quiz" button. Players will have 75 seconds to answer all multiple choice questions, and will be notified after each question if they got it "Correct" or "Wrong", however if they get an answer wrong 10 seconds will be deducted from the time and minus 1 from their score. I couldn't get my "Enter Initials" and "Leaderboards" pages to load, so I just included a prompt/alert so scores get loaded. If you open up DevTools, and click the Applications tab you can see the highscores get listed.
